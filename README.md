Bluenet is code running on [Crownstone](http://crownstone.rocks) compatible devices such as [electronic connectors](https://shop.crownstone.rocks/products/built-in-crownstone), [electronic EU plugs](https://shop.crownstone.rocks/products/crownstone-plugs) and [grid-powered beacons, Guidestones](https://shop.crownstone.rocks/products/guidestones). Each Crownstone or Guidestone is a node in a network that uses signal strength for indoor localization of smartphones and wearables.

## Features

- Made for indoor localization.
- Includes a mesh network.
- Power measuring.
- iBeacon compliant.
- Configurable over the air.

# Usage

To use a device with bluenet code on it, you only need to know the Bluetooth protocol that bluenet uses. You can find the protocol definitions in the [protocol document](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

# Build

To build the bluenet code yourself, follow the [installation instructions](docs/INSTALL.md).

# Communication

You can best communicate bugs and feature requests via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/issues). For all other questions, please, feel free to ask us anything on our [website](http://crownstone.rocks).

# Commercial use

This code is used in a commercial product, the [Crownstone](http://crownstone.rocks). Our intellectual property exists on two levels:

- The hardware is [patented](http://mijnoctrooi.rvo.nl/fo-eregister-view/search/details/1041053_NP/0/0/1/10/0/0/0/null_null/KG51bW1lcjooMTA0MTA1MykpIEFORCBwYXRlbnRSZWNvcmRTZXE6MQ==) under Dutch law with the main aim to protect you as a developer against fraudulent claims. 
- The software in these repositories allow developers to build a complete indoor localization system. We do have pro-versions of e.g. the basic [indoor localization library](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet-ios-basic-localization) to be used by other companies under a commercial license.

Summarized, as a developer you can build your own services on top of the Crownstone stack. Benefit from our software development as much as you want! For PR reasons, it would be much appreciated to if you mention us of course!
