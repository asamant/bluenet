<a name="setup"></a>
# Setup mode
When a Crownstone is new or factory reset, it will go into setup mode.

The setup process goes as follows:

- Crownstone is in setup mode ([Setup service](#setup_service) active).
- Phone connects to the Crownstone.
- Phone reads the **session key** and **session nonce** from the [setup service](#setup_service). These characteristics are not encrypted.
The values are only valid for this connection session. The session key and the session nonce will be used to encrypt the rest of the setup phase using AES 128 CTR as explained [here](#encrypted_write_read).
- Phone subscribes to [control](#setup_service) characteristic.
- Phone commands Crownstone to setup via the control characteristic.
- Phone waits for control characteristic result to become SUCCESS (See [result packet](#result_packet)).
- Crownstone will reboot to normal mode.



<a name="encryption"></a>
# Encryption
By default, Crownstones have encryption enabled as a security and privacy measure.

What is encrypted:

- The [service data](SERVICE_DATA.md) is encrypted using the service data key.
- Values that are **read from** the characteristics are encrypted unless specified differently.
- Values that are **written to** the characteristics are encrypted unless specified differently.
- Messages over the mesh.
- Broadcasted commands.


<a name="ecb_encryption"></a>
## AES 128 ECB encryption

Some packets are [ECB encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_.28ECB.29).


<a name="ctr_encryption"></a>
## AES 128 CTR encryption

We use the [AES 128 CTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_.28CTR.29) method to encrypt everything that is written to- and read from characteristics. For this you need an 8 byte number called a **nonce**. The counter starts at 0 for each packet, and is increased by 1 for every block of 16 bytes in the packet.

### Nonce

The nonce is a combination of 2 pieces: the session nonce and the packet nonce

![Nonce](../docs/diagrams/nonce.png)

Type | Name | Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
uint8 [] | Packet nonce | 3 | Packet nonce, sent with every packet (see [encrypted packet](#encrypted_packet)).
uint8 [] | Session nonce | 5 | Session nonce, can be [read](#session_nonce) once after connect (only changes on connect).

<a name="session_nonce"></a>
### Session nonce

After connecting, you first have to read the session nonce from the [Crownstone service](#crownstone_service). The session nonce is [ECB encrypted](#ecb_encryption) with the basic key. After decryption, you should verify whether you have read and decrypted succesfully by checking if the validation in the [data](#encrypted_session_nonce) is equal to **0xCAFEBABE**. If so, you now have the correct session nonce.

The session nonce has two purposes:

- Validation: the first 4 bytes of the session nonce is what we call the **validation key**, it is used in every [encrypted packet](#encrypted_packet), to verify that the correct key was used for decryption/encryption.
- Encryption: the whole 5 bytes are used for the nonce, which is used for CTR encryption.

The session nonce and validation key are only valid during the connection.

<a name="encrypted_session_nonce"></a>
#### Session nonce after ECB decryption

![Encrypted session nonce](../docs/diagrams/encrypted-session-nonce.png)

Type | Name | Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
uint 32 | Validation | 4 | 0xCAFEBABE as validation.
uint8 [] | Session nonce | 5 | The session nonce for this session.
uint8 [] | Padding | 7 | Zero-padding so that the whole packet is 16 bytes.


<a name="encrypted_write_read"></a>
## Reading and writing characteristics

When reading and writing characteristics, the data is wrapped in an [encrypted packet](#encrypted_packet).

After subscribing, notified data will be sent as [multipart notifications](#multipart_notifaction_packet).

<a name="multipart_notifaction_packet"></a>
### Multipart notification packet

When data is sent via notifications, it will be done via multiple notification packets.

![Multipart notification packet](../docs/diagrams/multipart-notification-packet.png)

Type | Name | Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
uint8 | Counter | 1 | Part counter: starts at 0, 255 for last packet.
uint8 [] | Data part |  | Part of the data.

Once you received the last packet, you should concatenate all data parts to get the payload (which is usually an [encrypted packet](#encrypted_packet)).

<a name="encrypted_packet"></a>
### Encrypted Packet

![Encrypted packet](../docs/diagrams/encrypted-packet.png)

Type | Name | Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
uint8 [] | Packet nonce | 3 | First 3 bytes of nonce used in the encryption of this message (see [CTR encryption](#ctr_encryption)).
uint8 | User level | 1 | 0: Admin, 1: Member, 2: Basic, 100: Setup
[Encrypted payload](#encrypted_payload) | Encrypted payload | N*16 | The encrypted payload of N blocks.

<a name="encrypted_payload"></a>
#### Encrypted payload

![Encrypted payload](../docs/diagrams/encrypted-payload.png)

Type | Name | Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
uint32 | Validation key | 4 | Should be equal to the read [validation key](#session_nonce).
uint8 | Payload |  | Whatever data would have been sent if encryption was disabled.
uint8 | Padding |  | Zero-padding so that the whole packet is of size N*16 bytes.






<a name="advertisement_data"></a>
# Advertisements
By default, [iBeacon advertisements](#ibeacon_adv_packet) will be broadcast  at a regular interval.
On top of that, [advertisements with service data](#service_data_adv_packet) are also broadcasted at regular interval. The [service data](SERVICE_DATA.md) contains useful info about the state of the Crownstone.

The iBeacon advertisements have a different MAC address, since these advertisements need to have the connectable flag to be unset.
The advertisements with service data will use the original MAC address, and will have the connectable flag set.
To calculate the MAC address used for iBeacon advertisements, simply subtract 1 from the first byte of the original MAC address (overflow only that byte, so it only changes the first byte).


<a name="ibeacon_adv_packet"></a>
### iBeacon advertisement packet
This packet is according to iBeacon spec, see for example [here](http://www.havlena.net/en/location-technologies/ibeacons-how-do-they-technically-work/).

<a name="broadcasts"></a>
# Broadcast commands

Some commands can also be sent via broadcasts. This is the prefered way, as there is no need to connect to the Crownstone, which takes quite some time.
The broadcast protocol is documented in the [broadcast protocol](BROADCAST_PROTOCOL.md) document.



<a name="services"></a>
# Services
When connected, the following services are available.

The AMB columns indicate which users can use these characteristics if encryption is enabled. The access can be further restricted per packet.

- A: Admin
- M: Member
- B: Basic

The following services are available (depending on state and config):
- [Crownstone service](#crownstone_service). Contains all you need: control, config and state.
- [Setup service](#setup_service). Similar to the crownstone service, replaces it when in setup mode.



<a name="crownstone_service"></a>
## Crownstone service

The crownstone service has UUID 24f00000-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff and provides all the functionality of the Crownstone through the following characteristics:

Characteristic | UUID | Date type | Description | A | M | B
--- | --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---:
Control        | 24f0000a-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | [Control packet](#control_packet) | Write a command to the crownstone. | x | x | x
Result         | 24f0000b-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | [Result packet](#result_packet) | Read the result of a command from the crownstone. | x | x | x
Session nonce  | 24f00008-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | uint 8 [5] | Read the [session nonce](#session_nonce). First 4 bytes are also used as validation key. |  |  | ECB
Recovery       | 24f00009-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | uint32 | Used for [recovery](#recovery). |

Every command written to the control characteristic returns a [result packet](#result_packet) on the result characteristic.
If commands have to be executed sequentially, make sure that the result packet of the previous command was received before calling the next (either by polling or subscribing).



<a name="recovery"></a>
#### Recovery
If you lost your encryption keys you can use this characteristic to factory reset the Crownstone.
This method is only available for 60 seconds after the Crownstone powers on.
You need to write **0xDEADBEEF** to it. Then, the Crownstone disconnects and goes into low TX mode so you'll have to be close to continue the factory reset. After this, you reconnect and write **0xDEADBEEF** again to this characteristic to factory reset the Crownstone.



<a name="setup_service"></a>
## Setup service

The setup service has UUID 24f10000-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff and is only available after a factory reset or when you first power on the Crownstone.
 When encryption is enabled, the control and both config characteristics are encrypted with AES CTR. The key and session nonce for this are gotten from their
 characteristics.

Characteristic | UUID | Date type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
MAC address    | 24f10002-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | uint 8 [6] | Read the MAC address of the crownstone.
Session key    | 24f10003-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | uint 8 [16] | Read the session key that will be for encryption.
GoTo DFU       | 24f10006-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | uint 8 | Write 66 to go to DFU.
Session nonce  | 24f10008-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | uint 8 [5] | Read the session nonce. First 4 bytes are also used as validation key.
Control        | 24f1000a-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | [Control packet](#control_packet) | Write a command to the crownstone.
Result         | 24f1000b-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff | [Result packet](#result_packet) | Read the result of a command from the crownstone.

Every command written to the control characteristic returns a [result packet](#result_packet) on the result characteristic.
If commands have to be executed sequentially, make sure that the result packet of the previous command was received before calling the next (either by polling or subscribing).

#### Switch state
To be able to distinguish between the relay and dimmer state, the switch state is a bit struct with the following layout:

![Switch State Packet](../docs/diagrams/switch_state_packet.png)

Bit | Name |  Description
--- | --- | ---
0 | Relay | Value of the relay, where 0 = OFF, 1 = ON.
1-7 | Dimmer | Value of the dimmer, where 100 if fully on, 0 is OFF, dimmed in between.
